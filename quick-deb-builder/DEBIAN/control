Description: Quick DEB Builder
 Quick DEB Builder is a simple tool that quickly creates .deb packages 
 from an existing build tree. Just insert a folder path with a "debian-like" 
 directory structure and an output folder path.
 .
 It automatically solves most common permission problems for files 
 and directories in creating .deb packages.
